Credit card fraud data is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/creepycrap/creditcard-fraud-dataset

The entire dataset is about 150 MB which is why I wasn't able to upload it to GitHub. Just click the given link to Kaggle if you're interested in using the same dataset as I did in my notebook example.
